            <div class="profile">
            <p>Across a wide range of roles: from administration, data processing, insurance and customer service
                to building trucks, working the kitchen and giving it my all at a coffeehouse. I have always approached every job 
                with structure, curiosity and a drive to do things well.</p>
            <p>I work intelligently, finish what I start and take real satisfaction in a job done right.</p>
            <p>These experiences shaped me into someone reliable, analytical, and adaptable: 
                the kind of person who learns fast, solves problems thoughtfully and brings order to complexity.</p>               
            <p>It’s a foundation that translates naturally into programming: disciplined, detail‑oriented and committed to 
                delivering solid, well‑crafted work.</p>
            <p>I've been using a PC for 30 years. Exploring, breaking & fixing things, and being the go‑to tech helper in my family. 
                With no role models or encouragement, I never considered studying tech. But the 
                curiosity never went away. Moving into programming later in life felt less like a switch 
                and more like finally stepping into something that had always been part of me.</p>
